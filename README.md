## 1. Lab Setup & Baseline Security

Two users were created:

| User    | Role         | Groups                |
|---------|--------------|-----------------------|
| manager | Privileged   | sudo, manager, users  |
| insider | Regular User | users                 |

A sensitive file was created:

ls -l /srv/company_secrets

text

**Figure 1:** Initial file permissions and ownership.

---

## 2. Attack Simulation & Exploitation

- Insider tries to access secret file; access denied.  
- Attempts to escalate privileges using `sudo`.  
- Admin adds insider to sudo group.  
- Insider accesses secret file successfully.

## 3. Forensic Investigation & Evidence

Investigation encompassed:

- Tracking insiderâ€™s `.bash_history` for malicious commands.
- Verifying group changes post-escalation.
- Checking login sessions correlating with attack timeline.

The `auth.log.sample` file captures critical authentication and privilege escalation activities during the insider attack simulation. It shows the insider user opening multiple sudo sessions to execute root-level commands, including launching a root shell and adding themselves to the sudo group. The log also records a failed SSH authentication attempt followed by a successful login, highlighting persistence efforts. Subsequently, the insider accesses the sensitive file with elevated privileges. Finally, the log records the administrator removing the insider from the sudo group, marking the remediation phase. These detailed log entries provide a clear timeline of the attack and mitigation efforts critical for forensic analysis and understanding the incidentâ€™s progression.

## 4. Remediation & Recovery Measures

- Insider removed from sudo group:  
sudo deluser insider sudo

text
- File ownership and permissions restored:  
sudo chown manager:manager /srv/company_secrets/secret_file.txt
sudo chmod 640 /srv/company_secrets/secret_file.txt

text
- Insiderâ€™s password reset:  
sudo passwd insider

## 5. Recommendations & Best Practices

- Enforce least privilege access.  
- Enable comprehensive logging with auditd/rsyslog.  
- Regular audits of user privileges and groups.  
- Strong password and session monitoring policies.  
- Deploy insider threat detection systems for realtime alerts.

---

## 6. Lessons Learned

- Insider threat detection requires auditing and monitoring.  
- Forensic artifacts such as shell history and logins are key.  
- Rapid remediation minimizes damage.  
- Defense-in-depth reduces risk of privilege escalation.
